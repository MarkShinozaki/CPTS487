Vision & Theme

- By the end of the semester we intend to have created a basic and easily expandable bullet hell 
experience which the user can easily modify by manipulating various json files which control the game entities values.

- Our theme will be “Dogs vs Cats” and we will carry that into our later art and sound design. 

- We hope to add elements such as player power-ups which will increase or decrease certain values 
during downtime as it would allow for interesting and fun variations in the actual game, 
making it replayable as every run can have different outcomes, and different approaches.

- We want to add 2 enemy types (grunts) which have different attack and movement patterns, 
as well as 2 bosses, one mid, and one end boss, which have more interesting and hard to dodge attacks than the grunts. 
During the boss phase the grunts will continue spawning  as helpers to the boss to attempt 
to make it harder for the player to not be hit.
