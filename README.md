### [Abstract Factory Pattern Handout](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS487-SoftwareDesign-Architecture/blob/Additional-Resources/AbstractFactoryPattern_handout%20(1).pdf)

- Explanation: This document discusses the Abstract Factory design pattern using a MazeGame example. It explains how to use factory methods to create different types of mazes (e.g., EnchantedMaze or BombedMaze) by abstracting the creation process into a factory that can be extended for different themes.


### [Builder Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS487-SoftwareDesign-Architecture/blob/Additional-Resources/Builder_Singleton_Patterns_handout.pdf)

- Explanation: This handout covers the Builder pattern, which is used to construct complex objects step by step, and the Singleton pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance. The document explains these patterns with examples and discusses their structure and use cases.


### [CompositePattern Handout](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS487-SoftwareDesign-Architecture/blob/Additional-Resources/CompositePattern_handout%20(1).pdf)

- The Composite Pattern is explained through an organizational hierarchy example where employees report to a manager. This pattern is useful for representing part-whole hierarchies. The handout discusses how to structure such systems and the benefits and drawbacks of the pattern.



### [DecoratorPattern Handout](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS487-SoftwareDesign-Architecture/blob/Additional-Resources/DecoratorPattern_handout.pdf)

- The document explains the Decorator Pattern, which allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. An example of adding disclaimers to emails illustrates how the pattern can be applied.


### [Factory Pattern Handout](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS487-SoftwareDesign-Architecture/blob/Additional-Resources/FactoryPattern_handout%20(2).pdf)

- This handout uses a PizzaStore example to explain the Factory Method pattern, where different pizza franchises create pizzas according to local tastes while maintaining a uniform preparation process. The document highlights how the pattern separates the creation process from the business logic.
